KKrcon - Text-mode Rcon client for Half-Life and Quake 1/2/3 game servers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package includes the KKrcon Perl Module, KKrcon.pm, which developers can
reuse in other Perl applications, and a wrapper script, kkrcon.pl, which allows
execution of rcon commands on the command-line or interactively, from any
text-mode terminal.


kkrcon.pl
---------

Usage:
  ./kkrcon.pl [OPTIONS] password [rcon_command [arg]...]

Example:
  ./kkrcon.pl -a 12.34.56.78 leethaxor

Run kkrcon.pl with -h or --help for details of all available command line
arguments.

If no rcon_command is given on the command line, the user will be interactively
prompted for commands to execute.


Troubleshooting:

If you get 'Command not found' errors make sure that perl is installed
and that the first line of kkrcon.pl points to where your perl lives.

If you get 'Can't find KKrcon.pm in @INC' errors make sure that KKrcon.pm is
either in the same directory as kkrcon.pl, or in a system Perl module dir.


KKrcon.pm
---------

This is a module which can be re-used in other Perl applications to provide Rcon
support.

Synopsis:

  use KKrcon;
  $rcon = new KKrcon(Password=>PASSWORD, [Host=>HOST], [Port=>PORT], [Type=>"new"|"old"]);
  $result  = $rcon->execute(COMMAND);
  %players = $rcon->getPlayers();
  $player  = $rcon->getPlayer(USERID);

Refer to kkrcon.pl for example usage.
